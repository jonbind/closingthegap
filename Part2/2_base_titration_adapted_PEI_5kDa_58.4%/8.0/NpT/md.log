The -nsteps functionality is deprecated, and may be removed in a future version. Consider using gmx convert-tpr -nsteps or changing the appropriate .mdp file field.

Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 1000000 steps, 8e+03 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 1.1 to 1.238


When checking whether update groups are usable:
  Domain decomposition is not active, so there is no need for update groups
1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 10 OpenMP threads 


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
System total charge: 0.000
Will do PME sum in reciprocal space for electrostatic interactions.

 is not yet equilibrated. Use of Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling during
equilibration can lead to simulation instability, and is discouraged.

Program:     gmx mdrun, version 2022.3
Source file: src/gromacs/mdlib/constr.cpp (line 240)

Fatal error:
Too many LINCS warnings (6724)
If you know what you are doing you can adjust the lincs warning threshold in
your mdp file
or set the environment variable GMX_MAXCONSTRWARN to -1,
but normally it is better to fix the problem
